### Making a contribution

I'm always happy to add new material to this list

## Adding a resource
If you want to add a resource please open a new issue or comment on a existing one.
I will review the article as I'd like this list to be quality over quantity.

## Requesting a resource
Head over to the [issues](https://github.com/timjacobi/angular-education/issues) page and create a new issue for your request and I will do a research.
